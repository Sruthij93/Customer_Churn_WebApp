# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project is part of my work as a Software Engineering Resident in the Headstarter Accelerator program. 
It aims to predict customer churn using a Kaggle dataset of bank customers by analysing customer behavior and building machine learning models that accurately predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn).

## Project Overview

This project executes different machine learning models for churn prediction and this repo includes the webapp section of the project.

The webapp was created using streamlit and deployed on Render.
