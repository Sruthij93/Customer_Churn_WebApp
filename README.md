# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project is part of my work as a Software Engineering Resident in the Headstarter Accelerator program. 
It aims to predict customer churn using a Kaggle dataset of bank customers by analysing customer behavior and building machine learning models that accurately predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn).

The webapp consists of a dashboard with customer profiles and the ML models' predictions. Using Llama 3.1b with Groq API, explanations to the predictions are generated. It explains the reasons as to why the customer maybe at a risk of churning or not. Along with prediction explanations, automated emails are generated that can be sent out to the customers, incentivizing them to stay with the bank. 

## Project Overview

This project executes different machine learning models for churn prediction and this repo includes the webapp section of the project.

The webapp was created using streamlit and deployed on Render.
